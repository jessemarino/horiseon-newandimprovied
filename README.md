Horiseon-NewandImprovied

This project was started for Horiseon to help them improve their website functionality. 

While going over html and css contents I noticed some links were unresponsive and needed updated semantic elements. Along with that there was repetative use of style elements in the CSS file. 

All links work correctly and semantic updates improved websites flow by removing repetitiveness. Codebase is optimized for search engines and follows accessibility standards.

I learned it is important to use proper semantics and reduce repetitiveness to reduce confusion.
